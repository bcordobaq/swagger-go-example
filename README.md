# Generating Swagger Docs From Go

A repository containing the same API thrice. One is documented with [go-swagger](https://github.com/go-swagger/go-swagger), other with [Swag](https://github.com/swaggo/swag), and another with [go-swagger3](https://github.com/parvez3019/go-swagger3).  
Which is better?

The first two libraries generates swagger 2.0 specs, the last one generates OpenAPI 3.0 specs.
